Many free assets were used, the license of these assets and their ownership
belong to their authors, usually we kept the link to the asset source near
the asset file, visit them if you want to make sure.

Near most asset files with the source and the license for that asset,
sometimes the original unmodified asset is a few folders deep in the asset
structure.

Code in this project unless otherwise specified is using the following license:
